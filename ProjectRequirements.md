## Description
You get to create your own final project! You may choose something that you are interested in or has something to do with a hobby you enjoy. You will come up with your own program that must include a number of the topics we talked about this semester as outlined below. You are not restricted to this list, but must utilize at least **SIX (6)** items from the following list:

- [ ] Strings Manipulation
- [ ] 2D Arrays
- [ ] File I/O (More than simply outputting)
- [ ] Command Line Arguments
- [ ] Pass by Pointer
- [ ] Structures
- [ ] Linked Lists (Pointers) 
- [ ] Header Files (Multiple C Files)
- [ ] Sorting
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Stack/Queue

The proper and fulfilling implementation of each of six items above will be worth 5 points each.

### Documentation
This documentation should be in a separate file in either plaintext `.txt` or markdown `.md` that describes your program, how to use it, and any included input files that are supplied and required.

Your documentation file should list the 6 topics that you included in your project that you are to be graded on.  Your documentation file should also include a description of your program, any requirements or dependencies, format of input files if required, and any other information about your project.

Your email should contain a short description of your idea, the topics you are going to cover, and how you plan on implementing these topics.  Keep in mind that this is a final project to showcase your entire semester's work.  Keep in mind the weight of this project in addition to how many points it is worth when designing your idea.

### Requirements
Your program should not be a simple implementation of six of the topics listed above but should include depth and thought, and it should make sense as a semi-real world example. The originality and creativity of your program will be graded, worth 5 points.

You must also include proper documentation for your program.  This should include (but isn't necessarily limited to) comments in the code where necessary, author name documented at the top of the program, and documentation on how to use the program, including what topics from the above list are included in the program.
